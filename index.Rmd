<!-- Interests -->
<p><strong>Interests</strong></p>
<p>My research lies at the intersection of infectious disease modeling, phylogenetics, and  epidemiology. I focus on integrating statistical and computational methods to understand the spread of infectious diseases, evaluate public health interventions, and contribute to data-driven policy decisions.</p>

<!-- Short Bio -->
<p><strong>Short Bio</strong></p>
<p>I am a medical doctor and epidemiologist at the University of Copenhagen. My work combines phylogenetic analysis and mathematical modeling to study infectious disease dynamics and inform public health strategies.</p>

<p>Prior to my PhD, I completed an MSc in Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and earned my MD degree from the University of Copenhagen. I have contributed to research projects in antimicrobial resistance, digital health, and public policy, aiming to bridge clinical expertise with quantitative research. During my PhD, I have been involved in teaching epidemiology to medical students, as well as leading collaborative projects focused on the use of genomic data and statistical modeling for infectious disease surveillance.</p>
