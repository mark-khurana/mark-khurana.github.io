<!-- Interests -->
<p><strong>Interests</strong></p>
<p>My research lies at the intersection of infectious disease modeling, phylogenetics, and  epidemiology. I focus on integrating statistical and computational methods to understand the spread of infectious diseases, evaluate public health interventions, and contribute to data-driven policy decisions.</p>

<!-- Short Bio -->
<p><strong>Short Bio</strong></p>
<p>I am a medical doctor and epidemiologist currently pursuing a PhD in Public Health at the University of Copenhagen under the supervision of Prof. Samir Bhatt. My work combines phylogenetic analysis and mathematical modeling to study infectious disease dynamics and inform public health strategies.</p>

<p>Prior to my PhD, I completed an MSc in Epidemiology at LSHTM (2021) and earned my MD degree from the University of Copenhagen (2022). I have contributed to research projects in antimicrobial resistance, digital health, and public policy, aiming to bridge clinical expertise with quantitative research. During my PhD, I have been involved in teaching epidemiology to medical students, as well as leading collaborative projects focused on the use of genomic data and statistical modeling for infectious disease surveillance.</p>
