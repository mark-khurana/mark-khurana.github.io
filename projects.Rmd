Khurana, University of Copenhagen</em><br> Published April 2023 • ISBN: 9781009354431</p> <p>In this book, I explore why medical research progresses in the way it does — shaped by incentives, institutions, and choices about which scientific paths to follow. I bring together perspectives from policy, economics, sociology, and philosophy to explain both the rate and direction of discovery. I also reflect on challenges such as flawed incentive structures, lobbying, and the lack of novelty in drug development, while offering ideas for improving how we pursue progress in medicine.</p> </div> </div>
