## Publications

The list below is automatically pulled from my Google Scholar profile:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(scholar)
library(knitr)

# Google Scholar ID
my_id <- "gQg4gOcAAAAJ"

# Fetch publications
my_pubs <- get_publications(my_id)

# Sort by year descending
my_pubs <- my_pubs[order(-my_pubs$year), ]

# Display table nicely
kable(
  my_pubs[, c("year", "title", "journal")],
  col.names = c("Year", "Title", "Journal"),
  align = c("c", "l", "l"),
  caption = "Publications from Google Scholar"
)
