The list below is automatically pulled from my Google Scholar profile:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(scholar)
library(knitr)

my_id <- "gQg4gOcAAAAJ"
my_pubs <- get_publications(my_id)
my_pubs <- my_pubs[order(-my_pubs$year), ]
# Display the publications table

  my_pubs[, c("year", "title", "journal")],
  col.names = c("Year", "Title", "Journal"),
  align = c("c", "l", "l"),
  caption = "Publications from Google Scholar"
)
